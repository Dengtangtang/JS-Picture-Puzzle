# A Picture Scramble Puzzle


## Descriptions
- An HTML5 JavaScript photo scramble app (that shows only valid combinations).
- No dependencies.
- It is now a static webapp, I may modify it and integrate it into my blog website.
- The effect after player wins the game is hard coded in wall.js, so it is not elegant and I did not track the image files, so you should add your own images.


## Unfinished Works
- I did not handle the resize function for Wall (wall.js) when players using mobiles alter the orientation.


## Built With
- Javascript
- CSS3
- HTML5


## Acknowledgments
- This app is forked from [grandecomplex/JS-Picture-Puzzle](https://github.com/grandecomplex/JS-Picture-Puzzle).
